# Database-Design-Vehicle-Breakdown-Project

For this project, I undertook the task of designing a data model for a breakdown assistance company using MySQL. The primary concept revolves around company members being required to register, with the flexibility of owning multiple vehicles. When a vehicle experiences a breakdown, an engineer is dispatched in a designated van for the service call. A crucial aspect of the operation involves the assignment of a new van to an engineer as soon as their current one surpasses the mileage threshold of 80000 miles.
